# cPanel AWS Integration Kit
The goal of this project is to develop an integration kit for users wishing to run a cPanel Architecture
on Amazon AWS services (EC2/VPC).

The challenge arises due to cPanel not natively supporting a NAT architecture. This kit takes advantage
of cPanel Hooks to modify DNS entries as well as additional configuration files.
